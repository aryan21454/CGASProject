# Recipe Preview and PDF Downloader

This project is a React-based web application for managing and interacting with recipe data. Users can view detailed recipe information in a modal, download recipe details as a PDF, and search for specific recipes dynamically.

## Features

- **Recipe Preview**: View detailed information about a selected recipe in a responsive modal.
- **PDF Download**: Export recipe details into a downloadable PDF file.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific recipes from a dataset or API.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive interface.
- **Interactive Icons**: Intuitive icons for actions like previewing and downloading PDFs.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF
- **Icons**: React Icons
- **Backend**: Node.js (for serving recipe data; not included in this repository but configurable)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-app.git
   cd recipe-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
